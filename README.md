## Hi there 👋

I am Salavat, I want to become a specialist in Data Science and DevOps. 
I am only a beginner programmer, but I will diligently learn everything new and welcome criticism. 

Fun facts about me: 
1.I really love to sleep! 
2.I don’t like it when people say you can’t do anything; everything is possible! 
3.I am tall but muscular. 
4.Also, I have experience as a machine and manipulator operator with programmable control! 
Hobbies: Anime, Games, Advanced mathematics, Chess, Working out, and learning everything new!

P.s I will keep updating my portfolio and post projects more often
